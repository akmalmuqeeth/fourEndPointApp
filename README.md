## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

Use the technologies of your choice but please add a small paragraph on why you choose that technology.

- The endpoints have to be able to handle versioning, please explain the strategy on how to accomplish this.

- If you have time please add pagination, if not please describe how the solution would support pagination

## Design decisions

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

### Why Node JS

<ul>
    <li>Its fast</li>
    <li>Quick to prototype REST Api's</li>
</ul>

**Why Express JS?** : simple routing, sessions and POST body/ query string parsing.

### versioning

Routes have the following structure:

-- server.js
-- router/
-- -- routes/
-- -- -- index.js
-- -- -- v1/
-- -- -- -- files.js
-- -- -- -- login.js
-- -- -- -- status.js
-- -- -- -- users.js
-- -- -- v2/
-- -- -- -- files.js
-- -- -- -- login.js
-- -- -- -- status.js
-- -- -- -- users.js

index.js contains the route declarations
    app.use('/api/login', require('./routes/v1/login'));

for the new version we could have the new routes in a directory called 'v2' anf the redeclare the routes as below:
    app.use('/api/login', require('./routes/v2/login'));



### paging



## Database setup

database : **userDB**

collection : **users**

mongoimport --db userDB --collection users --type json --file users.json

### Alternate database setup

If the mongoimport tool does not work, then data can be etered through the mongo shell using th following set of commands :

db.users.save({"username":"jesse","name":"jesse","password": "jesse", "city":"LA", "profession":"designer" });

db.users.save({"username":"adam","name":"adam","password": "adam", "city":"LA", "profession":"designer" });

db.users.save({"username":"mike","name":"mike","password": "mike", "city":"LA", "profession":"designer" });

db.users.save({"username":"gus","name":"gus","password": "gus", "city":"LA", "profession":"programmer" });

db.users.save({"username":"tuco","name":"tuco","password": "tuco", "city":"DC", "profession":"programmer" });

db.users.save({"username":"marie","name":"marie","password": "marie", "city":"NY", "profession":"manager" });

db.users.save({"username":"hank","name":"hank","password": "hank", "city":"IL", "profession":"waiter" });

db.users.save({"username":"walt","name":"walt","password": "walt", "city":"DC", "profession":"manager" });
